## 📝 Task Completion Log

### Task 1.1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Started**: Today  
**Completed**: Today  
**Description**: Initialized React app with Vite (TypeScript template) under `frontend/` and installed dependencies. Integrated design system tokens via `tokens.css` and updated base CSS to use variables. Created FastAPI backend skeleton (`backend/app/main.py`) with CORS and `/health` endpoint; installed core dependencies and verified the health check. Initialized Git repository with comprehensive .gitignore covering Python, Node.js, React, and development files; committed all initial project files. Configured environment variables structure with `env.example` template, Pydantic settings for backend, and frontend config with N8N integration support; created main project README with setup instructions. Configured PostgreSQL database with local installation, created database schema with SQLAlchemy models (users, shipments, trucks, documents, delivery_events, predictions), set up Alembic migrations, and seeded database with sample data for development. Set up N8N workflow automation platform using Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis, configured for embedded UI integration, created workflow management scripts, and updated all configuration files to support the complete development environment.
