🎨 Frontend Architecture Thoughts
Design System Philosophy
I recommend a modern, data-dense, professional approach that balances information density with usability:
Visual Design
Color Palette:
- Primary: Deep Blue (#1e40af) - Trust, reliability
- Secondary: Emerald (#10b981) - Success, on-time
- Warning: Amber (#f59e0b) - Delays, attention needed
- Danger: Red (#ef4444) - Critical issues
- Neutral: Slate grays - Professional, clean

Typography:
- Headers: Inter or Poppins (modern, clean)
- Body: System fonts (fast loading)
- Monospace: For tracking numbers, codes

Key UI/UX Decisions

Dashboard Layout

Left sidebar navigation (collapsible)
Main content area with breadcrumbs
Right panel for details/actions (slideout)
Persistent header with search and notifications


Mobile-First Responsive Design
Desktop: Full dashboard with all panels
Tablet: Collapsed sidebar, full content
Mobile: Bottom navigation, stacked cards

Real-time Updates

Subtle animations for new data
Toast notifications for alerts
Skeleton loaders during fetches
Optimistic UI updates


Data Visualization

Leaflet for maps (free, performant)
Recharts for charts (consistent, React-friendly)
Custom SVG for specialized visualizations


Performance Optimizations

React.lazy() for code splitting
Virtual scrolling for long lists
Debounced search inputs
Image lazy loading
PWA with offline support



State Management
javascript// Keep it simple initially
- React Context for global state (auth, notifications)
- Local state for component-specific data
- React Query for server state (caching, sync)
- Consider Zustand if complexity grows
Key Interactions

Drag & Drop - For document upload
Swipe Gestures - Mobile navigation
Keyboard Shortcuts - Power user features
Bulk Actions - Select multiple shipments
Quick Actions - Right-click context menus


📊 Success Metrics

Technical: <2s page load, 99% uptime, <100ms API response
