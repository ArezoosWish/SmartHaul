## Workflow Types

### 1. Document Processing Workflows
- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from uploaded documents
- **Data Validation**: Validate extracted data against business rules
- **Document Classification**: Categorize documents by type

### 2. Delivery Tracking Workflows
- **Real-time Updates**: Process GPS and status updates
- **ETA Calculations**: Calculate and update delivery times
- **Exception Handling**: Handle delivery delays and issues

### 3. Alert System Workflows
- **Delay Notifications**: Send alerts for potential delays
- **Status Updates**: Notify stakeholders of shipment status changes
- **Escalation Rules**: Escalate critical issues to management

## Usage

1. **Export Workflows**: Use N8N's export feature to save workflows as JSON
2. **Import Workflows**: Import JSON files into N8N for deployment
3. **Version Control**: Track workflow changes in Git
4. **Backup**: Regular backups of workflow configurations

## Integration with SmartHaul

These workflows integrate with the SmartHaul application through:
- **Webhooks**: Receive data from SmartHaul API
- **Database Operations**: Read/write to SmartHaul database
- **API Calls**: Interact with external services
- **File Operations**: Process uploaded documents

## Security

- Store sensitive credentials in N8N's encrypted credential store
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication for webhook endpoints
- Regular security audits of workflow permissions
