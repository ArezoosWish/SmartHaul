# N8N Workflows for SmartHaul

## 🎯 **What N8N Actually Does (vs Static Data)**

### **❌ Static Seeded Data (What we have now):**
- Fixed sample data that never changes
- No real-time updates
- No automation
- No intelligence

### **✅ N8N Automation (What we can build):**

#### **1. 🌤️ Weather-Based Delivery Updates**
```
Every 30 minutes:
1. Check all active shipments
2. Get weather for destination cities
3. If bad weather → Delay ETA by 2 hours
4. Create weather delay event
5. Update risk predictions
6. Send SMS to customers
```

#### **2. 🚛 Real-Time Truck Tracking**
```
When truck GPS updates:
1. Update truck location in database
2. Calculate new ETA based on traffic
3. If truck stops → Check if delivery location
4. If yes → Mark as delivered, send receipt
5. If no → Alert dispatcher about delay
```

#### **3. 📊 Intelligent Analytics**
```
Daily at 6 AM:
1. Analyze all deliveries from yesterday
2. Calculate success rates by route
3. Identify problem areas
4. Generate performance reports
5. Send summary to management
```

#### **4. 🔔 Smart Notifications**
```
When shipment status changes:
1. Send SMS to customer
2. Email warehouse for pickup
3. Update driver app
4. Log all communications
```
